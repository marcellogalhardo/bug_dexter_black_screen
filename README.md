# How To Simulate

Note the following details:
- Styles: AppTheme.
- AndroidManifest: Activity 'android: noHistory = "true"'

When you start the application, it should display a white screen says "Hello World."
When the permission dialog appears, select the "Deny" option.

Note that the application will behave in the following ways:
- Will keep a black screen (usually on the first run).
- Will close the application (the next time).

I hope this helps.
